## Overview
The city-explorer application is a React-based web application designed to allow users to explore information about various cities. The purpose of building this application is to provide users with a convenient way to access and visualize information about different cities, including their locations, landmarks, and geographical features. It is also being used to learn to work with Asynchronous code and APIs.

## Getting Started
To build and run the city-explorer application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub URL].
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Location IQ API key.
5. Run npm start to start the development server.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173/ to view the application.

## Architecture
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Location IQ Geocoding API: Third-party API used for retrieving geographical data about cities.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
